// I worked on Field.c

The lab was crucial to the development of my skills in c as they taught me how to use a state machine to make a video game. I think the most important aspect of this lab was reading the streams of data, as they are an essential tool for the next lab where we read in files instead of UART input. I learned a lot about the pic32 in this lab. I particularly learned about the UART interface and how this port in particlar works. I learned that while it may not read in bytes during its sleep mode, it rather queues them up and wait for the pic32 to wake up.

As I was searching the manual I found that the manual was not helpful whatsoever. The field library was not at all touched in the manual and protocol was very vague instructions. Agent was only in the header file comments. Additionally the state machine was incorrectly presented in the manual. Working with a partner was fun, as we helped each other get over humps which would have slowed our progress significantly had we worked as individuals.

The lab ended up taking around 15-17 hours in total, most of which were wasted by a very poorly worded manual. The points distribution is very askew towards the libraries which were easy to implement while the Agent was rather cumbersome. I did not go to class whatsoever for the entirety of this lab.
