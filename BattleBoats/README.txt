For this lab you will be working with a partner to develop the libraries and agents
necessary for a two-player game of BattleBoats, which resembles Hasbro’s Battleship™
game. There are two supporting libraries along with two playing agents, one with
artificial intelligence and one that is an interface for the human player, and a file
implementing main() that comprise this lab. You and your partner may split the work
such that each does one of the two libraries and then you both work together to
implement the Agent.
