CMPE 013 Lab5

I thought the most important aspect of this lab were working with malloc in an embedded environment. In an embedded processor we have a limited amount of memory, much less than what we would usually be used to in a desktop/laptop environment, so learning how to effectively utilize the available memory is valuable.

My general aproach to the lab is as always code first. Experienced with linked lists, I went right into coding the LinkedList.c file and then moved onto the sort.c algorithms. The only thing that went wrong in my coding was using the incorrect algorithm for sorting. Originally I had used bubble sort for the LinkedListSort function when we were supposed to use selection sort.

I ended up using around 8 hours for this lab, encountering many errors with the sortedWordCount algorithm. I haven't had to code something similar, as we usually use dictionaries and print the word count once. This is the only thing that I disliked about this lab. I would have preferred the dictionary implementation of a linked list rather than this. The points distribution was very fair, and as usual the lectures were the most helpful in completing this assignement.
