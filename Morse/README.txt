In this lab we learned more about state machines and we also learned about binary trees and tree traversals. What i thought was the most important aspect of this lab is learning how to do tree traversals since that is a really important part of computer engineering. Depth first inorder, postorder, and preorder all generate different outputs from the same tree. What I would have liked to see is tree searches rather than just simple traversals based on input. The functionality is cool, but the applications are very limited, specifically to a binary input. 

My general approach to the lab is to read the comments first. As usual, the only thing the manual is worth reading for is the state diagram. The manual suggested to start out with a heap size of 1024 which completely and utterly failed, so I had to change it to 2048. That was the only thing that went wrong with this assignment. If I were to redo this lab I would rather convert the dot dash input to a number which I can look up in a hash table. That would greatly speed up the program, but then again we are working in an embedded environment and hash tables take up space that is wasteful.

This ended up working pretty well, I spent around 10 hours programming this assignment. I liked the fact that it used some pretty cool data structures, but hated the application. Literally no one uses morse code. The points distribution was fair, although as usual I feel like the extra credit should be more. Either that or make the lab worth more overall.
