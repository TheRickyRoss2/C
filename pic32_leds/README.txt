Lab Partner for BattleBoats: kevin jung â€” kyjung

This lab was important in learning how to use the input and output of the pic32. Additionally, we investigated the inner workings of the hardware registers and how to communicate with them. On the software side, we learned about bit manipulation, enums, and macros.

My approach to the lab was to use the steps outlined near the end of the lab manual. The descriptions were very detailed, and following them step by step was just a matter of expanding upon what the manual specified. Near the end of the third lab, the part that gave me most trouble was the storage of sample values. Unlike the other two parts, we were not told to create a data structure for holding these values, so I tried to do that part without them and failed. The part that worked well for me was the OledPrinting, as sprintf nicely formatted the output string for me.

I ended up spending around 10 hours on this lab, since the lack of clarity for the third part threw me off a bit. The lab manual went into detail about the pic32 very extensively but did not help much at all in the latter portion. Quite honestly, going to class more would help me a lot. The points distribution was fair, although the third part should be rewarded more since it was much more difficult than the others.
