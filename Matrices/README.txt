This lab can be summarized in one word: arrays. The most daunting part of this lab was the indexing of the arrays and how to process the arrays based only on this information. Of course, we had the outlier functions determinant and inverse which we could hard code, but the rest were challenging in figuring out how to index the rows and columns correctly. 

My first steps were creating the base for loops for indexing the arrays, followed by encoding the operations within the functions. I did not read the lab manual first, except when it came to test case specification. The only thing that went wrong was incorrect indexing in the inverse function. I switched a few indices and had incorrect output.

I ended up spending a good 5-6 hours on this lab, although most of it was repeating redudant code and modifying it, such as the print statements for each test case. I considered a mutable array of chars which vayr based on the test, but it seemed much simpler to copy/paste the statements. The point distribution is fair, but I would have liked a clearer specification for the adjugate function.
